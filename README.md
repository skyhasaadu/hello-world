Tell all the truth but tell it slant<br/>
Success in Circuit lies<br/>
Too bright for our infirm Delight<br/>
The Truth's superb surprise<br/>
As Lightning to the Children eased<br/>
With explanation kind<br/>
The Truth must dazzle gradually<br/>
Or every man be blind â€”<br/>
<br/>
Emily Dickinson
